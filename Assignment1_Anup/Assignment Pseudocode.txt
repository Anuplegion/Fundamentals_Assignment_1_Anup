Pseudocode for Programs

-------------- Step 1 ----------------
Take user input for 30 students
	Check if input marks is greater than or equal to 0 and  less than or equal to 30
	If less than 0 or greater than 30 then show error
	Repeat until valid input recieved
Print all 30 inputs

Calculate Highest Mark
	Make a variable “maximum” and put 1st mark as maximum
	Check if next value is greater than “maximum”, 
	if yes make the larger mark =  “maximum”
	If No, compare with another value
	Repeat
After completion show the value in “maximum” as highest mark

Calculate lowest mark
	Make a temporary value “minimum” and put 1st mark = minimum
	Check if next value is less than “minimum”, 
	if yes; make the smaller mark “minimum”
	If No; compare with another value
	Repeat
After completion show the value in minimum as lowest mark

--------------- Step 2 -------------

Calculate mean 
	Create a sum variable
	Add all marks into sum
	Divide the sum by 30

Calculate Standard deviation
	Calculate sum of squared difference by subtracting marks and mean for each then squaring
	Calculate variance by adding all squared difference
	Calculate standard deviation by calculating square root of variance

In each step print each output.
