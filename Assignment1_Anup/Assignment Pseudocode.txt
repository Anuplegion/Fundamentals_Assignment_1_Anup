Check if next value is greater than “maximum”, 
if yes make the larger mark =  “maximum”
If No, compare with another value

Check if next value is less than “minimum”, 
if yes; make the smaller mark “minimum”
If No; compare with another value
Repeat
After completion show the value in minimum as lowest mark
Calculate mean 
Create a sum variable
Add all marks into sum
Divide the sum by 30
